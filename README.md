# fm-tools

First Motive's shared terminal tooling, as a pip-installable wheel.

## What

`fm-tools` carries the reusable, ROS-free half of First Motive's terminal UI:
the brand palette, the colour-coded step banners, the themed widget set, and a
generic `pick` menu. It was carved out of `fm-app`'s `fm_tui` package so any
First Motive repo can share one source of brand and one picker without pulling in
`rclpy` or the rest of the app.

The wheel depends only on `textual` and `rich` — no ROS, no `rclpy`. It imports
cleanly anywhere Python runs.

## Install

Distribution is git tag-pinned (PyPI-ready, not yet published):

```bash
uv pip install "fm-tools @ git+https://github.com/first-motive/fm-tools@v0.1.0"
```

## Usage

In Python:

```python
from fm_tools.tui import pick, emit

emit(1, "Detect OS")                       # branded step banner
backend = pick("Pick a backend", ["mujoco", "gazebo", "isaac"])
```

From a shell script (the `fm-pick` console entry prints the choice to stdout):

```bash
backend=$(fm-pick "Pick a backend" mujoco gazebo isaac)
```

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest
```
